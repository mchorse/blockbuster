/**
 * Client handler actor playback
 *
 * This client handler is responsible for starting actor playback. There are
 * few cases to consider.
 *
 * If the message says to stop playback, it is quite simple, but for start
 * playback there are few checks required to be made.
 *
 * If record exists on the client, we'll simply create new record player and
 * request tick and delay, just in case, for synchronization purpose, but if
 * client doesn't have a record, it should request the server to provide one.
