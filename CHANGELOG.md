# Change Log

Blockbuster's change log.

## Version 1.6.4

This is a quick hot patch update which fixes a couple of major issues I found after releasing 1.6.3, my bad guys...

**Compatible** with McLib `1.0.4`, Metamorph `1.1.10` and Aperture `1.3.5`. It doesn't mean that future versions of Metamorph and Aperture would be incompatible, but older versions are most likely incompatible.

* Added a config option for green sky color
* Added negative pre- and post-delays (suggested by Agirres)
* Fixed vanilla particle morphs to work with body parts
* Fixed limb pose and body part list after switching a model
* Fixed scenes not saving when switching between scenes
* Fixed scenes getting removed when being edited (stupid copy paste)
* Fixed animated pose feature not resetting correctly

## Version 1.6.3

This update introduces native support for MagicaVoxel (`*.vox`) models, Scenes (remote director blocks which are stored in files and managed in GUI), many new options, a couple of nice tweaks and workflow enhancements and, as always, bug and crash fixes.

## Version 1.6

This big massive update probably isn't as big as `1.5`, however, it saturated with so many awesome features that expand new horizons of machinima creation! Beside that, this update also makes Blockbuster much more stable than `1.5.3`.

This update adds three new types of special Blockbuster exclusive morphs, in addition to `image` morph: Sequencer, Record and Structure morphs. It also adds another several major features: multiskin, improved texture picker, custom model smooth shading, hide all director blocks (if hide on playback is enabled) upon playback, item slots support in body parts, several new image and custom model morph properties and dozens of bug fixes!

**Compatible** with McLib `1.0.1`, Metamorph `1.1.8` and Aperture `1.3.1`. It doesn't mean that future versions of Metamorph and Aperture would be incompatible, but older versions are most likely incompatible.

* Updated 1.12 build to 1.12.2

## Version 1.4.9 (OBJ and camera update)

This patch that mainly aims at providing integration with my new [Aperture](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/aperture) mod (a camera mod which camera creation process using GUI). This means that all old camera code in Blockbuster was removed.

For exception of camera features, there are also some little tweaks made to other components of the mod. Mostly tweaks that fix some annoying stuff. Oh, and also OBJ support for custom models.

**Compatible** with Metamorph `1.1.4` and Aperture `1.0.1`. It doesn't mean that future versions of Metamorph and Aperture would be incompatible, but older versions probably are incompatible.

<a href="https://youtu.be/R-g6fIUBtR4"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/R-g6fIUBtR4/0.jpg"></a> 

#### General

* Added support for Aperture mod
    * If you hold playback button attached to director block, you would be able to preview actors playback by scrubbing the timeline (bottom bar) or pressing play/pause button
    * Added support for camera launching for playback buttons
    * Added Blockbuster's camera editor options panel
* Dropped Minecraft `1.9.4` support and added Minecraft `1.12` support
* Toggle button teleport teleports you back to the place you teleported to director block in the first place (thanks to badr)
* More sophisticated teleport to director block (searches for a free block pos and aligns player's look toward director block)

#### Actors

* Added `.obj` model support 
* Added support for sitting on 3rd-party mods that provide sittable chairs for custom model based morphs only
* Added actor `freeze` checkbox #34 
* Remove entity shadows for invisible actors
* Remove stuck actors after exiting during director block's playback
* When actors spawn, align body with head

#### Commands

* Added `/action record` command to the history when pressing `Record` button in director block GUI (thanks to Tom Soel)

* Removed `/camera` command
* Removed `/load_chunks` command

#### GUI

* Added confirmation modal to the director block GUI (thanks to Sanchan, badr and others)
* Added label for morphs in morph pickers (thanks to Minebox)
* Added the support for displaying OBJ model parts in model editor
* Added GUI elements to modify `origin` and `providesObj` in model editor

#### Recording

* Added block placing sounds to `place_block` action (thanks to MadDreamer)
* Fixed attack action on the server (requires Easy difficulty, in order to hit player)
* Make actors make weak hit sound when swiping (configurable, by default disabled)

## Version 1.4.8 (integrated model editor)

Patch update. This update is focused on bringing [McME](https://mchorse.github.io/mcme/) into the mod itself. Why integrating model editor in the mod? Because this will increase productivity of making custom models. When you edit models in the game, you'll have instant feedback on how the model looks, meanwhile with McME, ther might be some bugs related to wrong angles between how custom model looks in the game and in the editor, how does the character would look with items in hand, etc.

**Important**: there's a new way of recording actions was implemented. Player recordings recorded in `1.4.8`, **can't** be used in 1.4.7 and below. However, you can use actions from `1.4.7` in `1.4.8`.

<a href="https://youtu.be/CoJ_6Byh6LA"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/CoJ_6Byh6LA/0.jpg"></a> 

#### Camera

* Added a config option for default path fixture interpolation
* Added smooth cubic interpolated camera, like cinematic vanilla but Minema-friendly, see `Options > Controls > Blockbuster Misc.`
* Added accelerated linear interpolation for roll and FOV when smooth camera enabled
* Added `hermite` interpolation type for path fixture (`/camera edit 0 hermite`)

#### Commands

* Added sub-commands:
    * `/model clear` – clears texture map cache from purple checkered textures
    * `/model replace_texture` – replaces texture in the texture map to another already loaded texture
    * `/load_chunks` – force loads all chunks in the render distance (affects only chunks which were already generated by the world)
* Updated `/record` sub-commands to multiple action per frame feature
    * Added `/record add` and `/record remove`
    * Removed `/record set`
* Updated `/camera duration` sub-command to take in account relative values (like with `/camera step` and `/camera rotate`)

#### Director block

* Make director block's sides highlight on play or on stop
* Fixed crash when actor uses playback button (thanks to Badr)

#### General

## Version 1.4.7 (Metamorph integration)

Another patch update. This patch update is what I waited for a long time! This update integrates Blockbuster with Metamorph. This makes Blockbuster able to perform Metamorph's abilities, attacks and abilities as well as to use Metamorph's morphs for actor morphing. From now and on, Blockbuster isn't a standalone mod. It requires [Metamorph](https://github.com/mchorse/metamorph).

**Important**: due to integration, the format of custom models and skins was changed, so before trying out this update, make sure to back up your world as it may make all your actors morphless (invisible actors with shadows).

Special thanks to **[The Minebox](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMinebox)**, **Badr**, **[Tom Soel](https://twitter.com/TomSoel)** and **[Vasily12345](https://www.youtube.com/user/MinecraftLifeSeries)** for beta-testing and suggesting features for this update!

* Flipped texture of **actor configuration** item (thanks to Tom Soel)
* Increased item pick-up delay (from `10` to `40`)
* Implemented item pick-up animation (item magnet-like animation)

#### Camera

* Added `cubic` path fixture interpolation
* Added keys for more precise player position and angle adjustments (under *Blockbuster Camera Control* category)

#### Commands

* Added `/camera path` subcommands:
    * `/camera path add` – add a point in a path fixture

    * `/camera path remove` – remove a point from path fixture
    * `/camera path move` – move a point to another index in a path fixture
    * `/camera path goto` – go to a point in a path fixture (like `/camera goto`, but specific for path fixtures)
* Added `/camera step` which moves player absolutely or relatively
* Added `/camera rotate` which rotates player absolutely or relatively
* Added `/director spawn` subcommand (spawns actors in director block at given tick in pause mode)
* Added `/record` command with four sub-commands:
    * `/record get` – output the data tag of the action in given player recording and tick
    * `/record set` – set an action in given player recording at given tick

* Added `MORPH_ACTION` action (which basically executes morph's action)
* Corrected `ATTACK` action's direction vector
* Fixed NPE crash at the end of playback with mounts (thanks to Tom Soel)

There were also few bugs during testing which lead to game crash, but they're not listed here, since they were fixed during the release (thus it will be inappropriate add them since they weren't present in previous update).

## Version 1.4.6

Another patch update. This patch is quite useful and contains one bug fix and two very useful config options. This patch fixes annoying scrolling in **director block** GUI and adds two config options for controlling render and tracking range of the actors, allowing players to render actors from much further distance (up to 1024 blocks away).

* Added `actor_rendering_range` config option (client related)
* Added `actor_tracking_range` config option (server related)
* Added a label on top of text field in **director block** GUI
* Added `DAMAGE` action which does self-damage to the entity actor
* Added the ability to *commit suicide* during recording (simply use `/kill` command during recording)
* Fixed reset scrolling bug in **director block** GUI

## Version 1.4.5

Another patch update. This patch adds an attack action, fixes hand held items position slightly, and adds two options.

* Added `ATTACK` action (now you can hit entities, yay! Unfortunately, it's always `2.0` damage)
* Added two mod options:
    * Apply fall damage (by default is `true`)
    * Record attack action on hand swipe (by default is `false`)
* Fixed hand held items positions (they were a little bit off)
* Fixed X-axis aligned first person display of arms

## Version 1.4.4

Another patch update. This patch fixes bugs which were found by users. Those are mostly actor bugs.

* Apply fall damage on actors (reported by AlpesH312)
* Make actors trigger pressure plates (reported by Tilairgan, long time ago)
* Fixed (for 1.11 version) holding hand status (reported by Juan Lopez on YT)

## Version 1.4.3

Another patch update. This patch is aimed at fixing few things and maybe some enhancements. 

* Changed the recording command message to `To record $name, click here.` (for understanding which actor to record)
* Fixed `steve` and `alex` armor desynchronization
* When invoked `/action record` with director block coordinates and if director block is playing, then stop director block playback

## Version 1.4.2

This is a small patch that adds few user requested features. Somebody might be excited for this.

* Added legacy compatibility for pre-`1.3` director blocks (requested by NlL5)
* Added support for arm postures and item animations (suggested by RedComet2000)
    * Comes in effect after making a new player recordings (since some new data needs to be recorded)
* Added `Hands` field in player recording frame data structure

## Version 1.4.1

This is a small patch that fixes several things, and adds one configuration option.

* Added `Switch to Spectator` configuration option in `Camera` category
* Added creation of `alex` and `steve` skins folders (thanks to badr and to people who didn't knew where to put their skins)
* Fixed `Error executing task` while saving of player recordings

## Version 1.4 (Slow-Mo update)

This is a big update that improves the quality of recording. Now you can use [Minema mod](https://github.com/daipenger/minema/releases) to record high quality videos of your machinimas (with shaders... **HYPE mode activated**).

The player recording code was almost rewritten from scratch and camera code was altered enough to support frame-based playback and synchronization with actor playback. In simple words, now you can capture smooth high-quality machinimas with Minema!

* Added actor spawn egg to Blockbuster tab
* Added button "Record" which simplifies recording of ghost actors
* Added camera tracking (server will remember which camera profile you had)

    * General
        * Send models and skins when player logs in?
        * Clean downloads folder when exiting from server
    * Recording
        * Recording frame delay
        * Automatic record unload time
        * Turn on automatic record unloading?
        * Record tick synchronization rate
    * Camera
        * Default fixture duration
        * Duration increase/decrease step
        * Interpolate target fixtures?
        * Target interpolation value
* Added more detailed tooltips to items and blocks

    * `/camera default` – reset camera's roll and FOV
    * `/camera fov` – set FOV of the camera
    * `/camera roll` – set roll of the camera
* Added sub-commands for `/action`:
    * `/action clear` – clears cached records on the client
    * `/action request` – requests server to send a record to current client
* Added support for `ResourceLocation` skins (you can reference Minecraft or other mod resources using `domain:path` format)
* Changed default scale of the actors to correspond to real players (@NlL5)
* Converted camera profile format to JSON
* Converted player recording format to NBT
* Fixed actor detaching (@NlL5)
* Improved player recording (smooth as silk)

* Removed shadows for invisible actors (@NlL5)
* Removed camera duration formatting (`s`, `m` and `h` suffixes are gone)
* Renamed the "Undocumented Feature" to "Camera Marker."

**Important**: camera and recording files from previous versions not supported by this update (I'm sorry, I'm really really bad at supporting formats). Next version will be less likely to break the format. Sorry... 

## Version 1.3

This is a big update that brings custom models and morphing into the game. This update adds support for custom models and player morphing. Your machinimas will be much interesting, because now you can record not only players, but also `mobs`, `blocks`, or even your own custom creatures. All thanks to custom models!

**Showcase video** for 1.3:  
<a href="https://youtu.be/WXrBEQZrQ7Q?list=PL6UPd2Tj65nGxteZIdEE_fIga7_HoZJ9w"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/WXrBEQZrQ7Q/0.jpg"></a>

* Added support for placing multiblock blocks (like bed or door)
* Fixed crash on dedicated server (previously known to be fixed)

See McME [repository](https://github.com/mchorse/mcme) 
and [web page](https://mchorse.github.io/mcme/) for more information about the model 
editor.

**Important**: This update breaks save data compatability with previous versions. So if you're going to use this update with previously created worlds, all director blocks are going to be cleared (unintentionally), and actors will lose their `Filename` fields.

## Version 1.2.1

This is a small patch that enhances existing elements of the mod. Nothing new, just enhancements and fixes.

**Showcase video** for 1.2.1:  
<a href="https://youtu.be/mDCYX1oRKYk?list=PL6UPd2Tj65nHvEH-_F_brz6LQDdlsCIXJ"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/mDCYX1oRKYk/0.jpg"></a>

* Changed playback button behavior – now it toggles playback instead of play only
* Changed playback button behavior on sneak and use – now you teleport to director block
* Changed path fixture behavior when you `/camera edit` it, instead of adding/removing, you pass it index of point, and edit the point's position
* Fixed director block GUIs – now scroll bar is draggable, and buttons are clickable
* Improved skin picker in actor GUI – now it supports tab completition and much easier to use when you have tons of skins

## Version 1.2

Third version of Blockbuster mod. This release focuses on improving cameras. 
Old entity-like camera was removed, and more flexible and complex cameras were 
added. Now, instead of riding cameras every time when you doing screen recording, 
you can just press play button and sit down, because you setup once, play camera 
how many times you want.

**Showcase video** for 1.2:

* Added camera profile. Camera profile is a list of camera fixtures that can be 
  imported/exported and played
* Added camera fixtures. Camera fixture is the definition of how camera should 
  behave. Following fixtures were added:
  	* Idle fixture – static camera shot 
    * Path fixture – linear-interpolated camera path way
    * Follow fixture – camera follows given entity from specified angle 
      (specified angle is determined when the fixture is being added) 
    * Look fixture – camera looks at given entity from specified point of view
      (specified point of view is determined when the fixture is being added)
    * Circular fixture – camera circles around given point for specified amount 
      of circles in degrees
* Added `camera` command which allows players to manage profiles and fixtures
* Added camera profile rendering
* Added camera key bindings for:
	* Removing last fixture
	* Adding idle, look or follow fixture to current camera profile
	* Toggle camera profile rendering
	* Start or stop camera profile
* Added lava and water support to place block action
* Added playback button GUI and lores
* Fixed actor's rotation when he is spawned with `/action play` command
* Merged `play-director` and `stop-director` into `director` command
* Merged `record` and `play` into `action` command
* Removed camera item, camera entity, camera jump key bindings, and camera 
  entities support in director block

## Version 1.1

Second version of Blockbuster mod. This release removes the "Name Tag" mechanism 
(redundant running here and there with intention to register/give recording name 
to the actor/director map block) and substituted this with *nice looking* GUIs.

Basically, this release mostly focuses on enhancing GUI and the look of the mod.

**Showcase video** for 1.1:  
<a href="https://youtu.be/mjvWD9rIO0U"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/mjvWD9rIO0U/0.jpg"></a>

* Added HUD overlay while player recording (red circle with caption in top-left 
  corner of the screen)
* Added arm pose while holding a bow
* Added `stop-director` command which allows you to stop playback of director at 
  specified position
* Renamed _skin manager device_ to _actor manager device_
* Changed actor behavior regarding name of the recording, now file name of the 
  recording is not depends on the actor's name tag, but stored in separate 
  field in actor's class. Use _actor configuration device_ to change to which 
  file actor is being recorded (see Recording ID field)
* Changed (improved) camera and actor configuration GUIs
* Changed camera's model and texture
* Fixed place block action, now actors can place any block (before, they couldn't place redstone wire) 
* Fixed crash on dedicated server
* Removed "Name Tag" mechanism
* Reduced the amount of console messages
* Recording format was broken, so old recordings won't work

P.S.: where "*nice looking* GUIs" is a subjective statement
