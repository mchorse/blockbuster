                strength: Damping - reduce the velocity on impact. Valid values are between 0 and 1. 1=highest damping -> reduces velocity completely
                randomness: Randomize the damping
            splitParticle:
                title: Split particle
                
                count: Split the particle on impact into the given count - speed is divided by the count
                speedThreshold: speed threshold to activate the split process
            radius: Radius of particle's hitbox
            expire: Expire on contact
            expirationDelay: Delay the expiration. Measured in ticks - 20 = 1 second
