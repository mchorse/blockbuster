blockbuster.config.comments:
    general:
        show_first_time_modal: Whether first time modal should be shown in the dashboard
        extra_wubs: This option does literally nothing. Or maybe it does...?

        add_utility_blocks: Add blocks such as command and structure blocks to Blockbuster's creative tab to simplify access to these items
        bb_gun_sync_distance: If it's greater than 0, this option enables BB gun projectile synchronization, which makes projectile sync with the server, but at the cost of jittery teleportation

        model_block_disable_rendering: Whether model blocks should be rendered
        model_block_disable_item_rendering: Whether model block item rendering should be disabled (who would want that?)

        record_pause_preview: This option enabled preview of animated morphs like image morph animations, animated poses, record morphs and sequencers. It's affects performance of the server side.

        damage_control_distance: Radius of effect for damage control

    model_folders:
        path: Absolute path to additional model Folder (on windows add the drive letter)

    snowstorm:
        depth_sorting: When enabled is fixes the particles being seen behind other semi-transparent particles. This option is very performance intensive, consider it using only when rendering video footage

    audio:
        waveform_visible: Whether audio bars should be shown when they're playing back
        waveform_density: How many pixels of audio waveform should be shown per second
        waveform_width: Width of an audio bar in floating point percentage (between 0 and 1)
        waveform_height: Height of an audio bar in pixels
        waveform_filename: Whether filename of the played audio in the audio should be shown
        waveform_time: Whether audio track's playback time should be displayed. Keep in mind that audio track's playback time doesn't necessarily represent scene's current playback time!
