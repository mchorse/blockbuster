                    {r}{l}Attention{r}: those models are automatically generated and aren't perfect. You'll need to adjust those models in McME to get best result.

            record:

                    {r}Records an action from current player into given {7}<filename>{r}. You can also optionally specify {7}[x]{f}, {7}[y]{f} and {7}[z]{f} coordinates of director block for which you want to record this recording. Supplying director block coordinates, helps out with synchronizing the actors.
            request:
